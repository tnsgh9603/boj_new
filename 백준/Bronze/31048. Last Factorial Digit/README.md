### 문제 설명

<p>The factorial of $N$, written as $N!$, is defined as the product of all the integers from $1$ to $N$. For example, $3! = 1 \times 2 \times 3 = 6$.</p>

<p>This number can be very large, so instead of computing the entire product, just compute the last digit of $N!$ (when $N!$ is written in base $10$).</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input contains a positive integer $1 \leq T \leq 10$, the number of test cases. Each of the next $T$ lines contains a single positive integer $N$. $N$ is at most $10$.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each value of $N$, print the last digit of $N!$.</p>
